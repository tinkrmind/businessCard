# Business Card

Designed during [Visual Language](https://itp.nyu.edu/~kd49/design/) class at ITP. 

Details of the design process can be found at my [blog](https://tinkrmind.me/2017/10/18/designing-a-business-card/). 

I wanted the cards to be PCBs. So, I designed the boards in Eagle and exported the gerbers. Then I changed the gerber file extensions to match the specifications on [elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html). I viewed the gerbers in [gerbv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gerbv/). When I was sure that the boards look good, I made a panel of boards using [gerber panelizer](http://blog.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/projects/pcb-panelizer/). I followed [this](https://hackaday.io/project/19202-small-pcbs-for-panelizing-tutorial/log/59210-panelization-using-gerberpanelizer-on-windows-linux-possible) great guide by hackaday for this. This is a lot easier than making the panels in Eagle [directly](http://diy.viktak.com/2013/02/tutorial-panelizing-pcbs-in-eagle.html). 

As a result I was able to fit 2 boards in one 10x10cm panel. That's some serious savings!
